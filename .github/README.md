# Xenia Canary Game Patches
This repository contains game patches for Xenia Canary.

[![Game Patches Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/930763773109735484?color=5865F2&label=Game%20Patches%20Discord&logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.gg/fyRWq3xYNz)

## Installing/Updating
1. Download the [zip](../../../releases/latest/download/game-patches.zip) file.
2. Open Xenia Canary.
3. Click `Open` > `Show content directory...`
4. Go up one folder.
5. Delete `patches` folder if present.
6. Open `game-patches.zip` and extract `patches` to the directory that contains `content`.
7. Continue to [enabling patches](#Enabling-patches).

### Enabling patches
`apply_patches` must be set to `true` in the Xenia Canary config!

To enable patches, open the .patch.toml file that corresponds to your game in a text editor (Notepad, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), etc.), and change `is_enabled` from `false` to `true`.

#
#### Note about aspect ratio patches
**`present_letterbox` must be changed from `true` to `false`!**

These patches **do not** increase resolution!

While most aspect ratio patches are 21:9 (3440/1440), they can be changed to other aspect ratios as well;
  1. Divide your monitor's resolution width by height (i.e. 3440/1440)
  2. [Convert the result to hex](https://gregstoll.com/~gregstoll/floattohex).
  3. Change the value to `0x########` replacing `########` with the hex value.

#### Note about framerate patches
Framerates higher than 60 FPS require vsync to be changed from true to false in the Xenia Canary config.

## Troubleshooting
If the above sections didn't help, you can try the following:
1. Make sure you followed [Enabling patches](#Enabling-patches).
2. Make sure you have the right version of the game.
3. Make sure you have the latest version of Xenia Canary experimental.
4. Try deleting all of your patches and [updating them](#Installing/Updating).
5. Try commenting out the `hash` of the patch like so:
    ```toml
    # Add # before hash
    hash = "################"
    # like this
    #hash = "################"
    ```
    **This isn't guaranteed to work, and may cause crashes.**
    <br>Hashes are used to verify the correct version of a game is being patched, and this bypasses it.
    <br><br>If the game has multiple modules you will need to [get the hash(es)](#How-to-get-the-module-hash-and-filename)

## Setting up Cheat Engine
* Memory Breakpoints can be set in Cheat Engine or MSVC with [`emit_source_annotations = true`](https://github.com/xenia-canary/xenia-canary/wiki/Options). This will give annotations in disassembly.
* Cheat Engine 7.2+ includes Big Endian types, but they must be enabled;
  * Click `Edit` > `Options` > `Extra Custom Types` and check all of them.
* Go to `Scan Settings` and enable `MEM_MAPPED`.
* Change 'Memory Scan Options' to:
  |     | All
  ----- | :----------
  Start | `100000000`
  Stop  | `200000000`
  * This may change depending on the programs you have running.
* Once you find a value you can attach Cheat Engine's debugger to see what reads/writes to that address.
<br>This will show an xex address when a breakpoint is hit, although there is currently no way to set a breakpoint on execution within the Xenia Debugger.

## Creating a patch
### Prerequisites
* [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org)
  * See [setting up Cheat Engine](#Setting-up-Cheat-Engine)
* [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/)
  * [XEX Loader](https://github.com/zeroKilo/XEXLoaderWV/releases)
* [IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/)
  * [IDA 7 XEX Loader](https://github.com/emoose/idaxex)
  * [IDA 6 XEX Loader](https://xorloser.com/blog/?p=395)
* Text editors:
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)
  * [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
* Recommended but optional:
  * [ESLint TOML plugin](https://ota-meshi.github.io/eslint-plugin-toml/user-guide/#installation)
    * See [Editor Integrations](https://ota-meshi.github.io/eslint-plugin-toml/user-guide/#editor-integrations)
  * Visual Studio Code/VSCodium extensions:
    * [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml)
  * To make things easier, put Xenia Canary in the directory that contains `/patches` and run it with [`portable.txt`](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/wiki/Options#how-to-use).

### Guidelines
* Patch must be named `Title ID - Game Title.patch.toml` and be in `/patches`.
<br>For example, a patch file for Blue Dragon must be called `4D5307DF - Blue Dragon.patch.toml`.
* If you are making a patch for a game that already has a file, then add to it*
  * Only exception being if you're patching a different module.
* Submitting patches:
  * No whitespace.
  * Lowercase hex for address/value hex, uppercase for title ID/hash/media ID.

### How to get the module hash and filename:
1. Set [`log_level`](https://github.com/xenia-canary/xenia-canary/wiki/Options) to at least [`2` (default)](https://github.com/xenia-canary/xenia-canary/wiki/Options) in the Xenia Canary config; See [How to use](https://github.com/xenia-canary/xenia-canary/wiki/Options#how-to-use) for location.
2. Run the game at least once.
3. Close Xenia Canary.
4. Obtain module hash/title ID/title name;
    * Search <kbd>Ctrl+F</kbd> for `Module hash:` in `xenia.log`
    <br>You should see something like:
      ```
      i> ######## Module \Device\Cdrom0\default.xex:
      Module Hash: ################
      ```
    * Patches can have multiple executables/hashes. Only leave the hash(es) you're using uncommented:

### Example patch
```toml
title_name = "Game Title"
title_id = "1234ABCD" # AB-1234
hash = "################" # Module the hash applies to (i.e. default.xex)
          # Can be an array if applicable:
hash = [
  "################"     # See above
]
#media_id = "1234ABCD" # Optionally you can add a redump link; Disc (Region): http://redump.org/disc/1234
#                        Can also be an array if applicable:
#media_id = [
#  "1234ABCD"          # See above
#]
# Title ID, hash, and media ID must be uppercase.

[[patch]]
  name = "Patch name"
  author = "Me"
  desc = "Patch description" # Description is optional
  is_enabled = false         # Must be false for PRs

# [[patch.*]]
#  For example, be8:
  [[patch.be8]]
    address = 0x82000000 # Tends to start with 0x8, always 4 bytes
    value = 0x00
#  Address and value hex must be lowercase.
#   string:
  [[patch.string]]
    address = 0x82000000 # Tends to start with 0x8, always 4 bytes
    value = "string"
# End of file newline
```
